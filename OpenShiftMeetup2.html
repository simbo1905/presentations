      # Upgrading C# ASP.NET Government Digital Services to use OpenShift?

      Created by [https://twitter.com/intermediation](https://twitter.com/intermediation) for the [Openshift London meetup #2](https://www.meetup.com/London-OpenShift-User-Group/events/240052148/?gj=wc1c.2_e&rv=wc1c.2_e&_af=event&_af_eid=240052148&https=on)

      # Agenda

      - Government Services
      - Why OpenShift?
      - ASP.Who?
      - Why Now?
      - Feasibility of adoption?
      - Gender Pay Gap Reporting service
      - Demo: Official Microsoft ASP.NET Core demo app on Openshift

      ---

      # UK Government Services (PaaS perspective)

      Context:
      - Operational services
      - Often a legislative mandate
      - User research driven

      Opinionated:
      - [GDS service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)
      - GDS governance (discover, alpha, beta, live)
      - Build the minimum viable service then continuously improve it
      - Short feedback cycle (aka Agile)
      - Use open standards and common platforms
      - Code in the open and open code (public repos, public license)
      - Prefer open source (implied by other preferences)
      - Accessible web interfaces
      - User focused
      - Evidence-based

      ???

      (people both running and using)
      (duty of care to provide excellent user experiences)

      # Why Openshift?

      - Open-source PaaS with commercial support
      - Cloud-agnostic abstraction layer turning IaaS into PaaS
      - Developer experience on a par with Heroku
      - Supports Git or Docker driven developer workflows
      - Runs on your laptop
      - Multi-tenant your dev environment for fast cheap alphas
      - Kubernetes and Docker which are becoming defacto standards
      - Advanced features (Blue-Green deployments, AB/MV testing)
      - Stack agnostic
      - IMHO less opinionated that others

      ???

      just some of the things
      in no particular order
      (BYOD IaaS upgraded to PaaS)
      Kubernetes and Docker (best in class resource management and interoperability)
      as lets you under the hood (a massive virtue in real world deployments)
      (automatic rollback for automatic continuous delivery)
      (split traffic to test  user experience changes in production or refactoring)
      (bring your own toolchain)
      (IMHO Microsoft's open source Docker toolchain will win more mindshare)

      # C# ASP.NET

      - ASP.NET is Microsoft's server-side web application framework
      - Originally closed source and intermingled with Windows
      - Entity Framework is Microsoft's ORM
      - Both now Apache 2.0 license and on [GitHub](https://www.asp.net/open-source)
      - Both now rewritten as cross platform "Core" (aka `dotnet`)
      - New version runs on Windows, Linux or MacOS
      - Microsoft has official ".Net Core SDK" Docker images (see demo later)
      - Official images use Debian Linux build packs
      - Kestrel web server uses `libuv` which Node.js uses
      - Microsoft is now a platinum member of the Linux Foundation
      - Microsoft and RedHat are partners so Azure runs Openshift
      - Microsoft and RedHat are doing a talk on [running SQLServer in Openshift July 11th](http://bit.ly/2sCrMGN)

      # Why Now (and not last year)?

      - Visual Studio 2015 couldn't read `dotnet` project files 😡
      - `MSBuild` engine is now open source  😇
      - `dotnet` recently switched to use *.csproj project files 👍
      - Visual Studio 2017 CE has a developer pack with Docker support 😍
      - Visual Studio Code (open source IDE) can debug on MacOS or Linux 😇
      - `dotnet 2.0` preview release May 2017 👏
      - Open source stack is actively promoted by Microsoft 😇

      ???

      so alive, kicking and mature
      (personal experience when discussing training for new hire junior developers)

      # Feasibility of adoption?

      - Analysis of a real service and spike work
      - What's typically deployed to Azure PaaS?
      - Could it be written the open source ASP.NET stack?
      - How would it map onto Openshift?
      - Does the official `dotnet` demo app run on commercially supported Openshift?

      # Gender Pay Gap Reporting Service

      - [Gender Pay Gap Reporting](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gender-pay-gap-reporting-overview) is on Github at https://github.com/DFEAGILEDEVOPS/gender-pay-gap
      - Uses the older ASP.NET and Entity Framework
      - Small agile team with two developers
      - Relatively sophisticated
      - Looks like similar other G2B web apps built on Azure at https://github.com/SkillsFundingAgency

      Findings:

      - ASP.NET Legacy -> ASP.NET Core
      - Entity Framework Legacy -> Entity Framework Core
      - Azure WebJobs -> Openshift Joabs
      - AzureSQL -> AzureSQL, AWS RDS SQLServer, SQLServer Linux (preview), Docker (preview)

      Conclusion:

      - IMHO FOSS C# can now give Java a good run for its money...
